# 3d-engine
A special equation that converts any 3-D space coordinate to a 2-D perspective projection. I don't like linear algebra, so I made my own formula that converts a single point in 3D space to a 2D plane that is 1920x1080. I used the concept of parallax from astronomy where stars far away appear to move slow and close stars appear to move fast. I also included rotations in my equation, and it works, but that code had a lot of bugs. I don't have much time anymore to debug, so that's a later problem. The main goal of this project was for me to make my own way of representing 3D data on a 2D screen for a higher dimensional wave equation, and also other things in the future.
